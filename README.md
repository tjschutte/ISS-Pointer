# ISS-Pointer
Program to grab the location of the ISS and then be able to convert this to something useful. Ideally this will be powering a servo arm
that will point at where-ever the ISS can be found at in the sky.

Goals:
-Make it give longitude and latitude
-Make it give longiture and latitude adjusted for current position. IE adjust where it claims to look based on where we claim to be.
